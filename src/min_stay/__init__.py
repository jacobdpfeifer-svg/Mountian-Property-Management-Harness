"""Dynamic minimum-stay resolution (date/season × lead time) + gap overrides.

Large-group luxury homes need LOS rules that protect peak weekends far out and
relax close-in so inventory fills. Orphan gaps shorter than the standing rule
temporarily override that rule so the hole remains sellable.

OWNER-TUNABLE: Exact buckets and night counts live in
`config/policies/default.yaml` → `min_stay_rules`. Defaults are reasoned starting
points for Winter Park sleeps-16–18 homes — confirm with the property owner
before trusting auto-push of minNights.
