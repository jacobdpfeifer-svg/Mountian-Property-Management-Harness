"""Pooled booking-probability model — what makes RevPAN a real objective.

The v1 build declared RevPAN as the core metric but never estimated a booking
probability: `expected_book_prob` was written to the schema as NULL on every row,
and price was chosen by multiplying rules together. That optimizes a rate, not a
revenue-per-available-night.

Model (deliberately transparent, small-data safe) — FIRST-ORDER LINEAR DEMAND:

    p(book | P) = p_ref * (1 + beta * (P / P_ref - 1))    clamped to [0.001, 0.995]

A constant-elasticity form p = p_ref*(P/P_ref)**beta is the textbook choice but is
DEGENERATE for optimization: E[rev] = const * P**(1+beta) is monotone in P, so the
optimizer always returns the floor (|beta|>1) or the ceiling (|beta|<1) and never an
interior price. Linear demand makes expected revenue quadratic in P, so there is a
real interior optimum:

    P* = P_ref * (beta - 1) / (2 * beta)

which is above the reference price when demand is inelastic (beta=-0.65 -> 1.27x) and
below it when elastic (beta=-1.70 -> 0.79x). beta is the local slope of demand at
P_ref, not a global elasticity.

  * p_ref  — historical booking rate for the (season, demand_tier, dow_class) cell,
             shrunk toward the portfolio prior. Pooled across properties: per-property
             per-cell rates are single-digit-N and would overfit badly.
             DEMAND TIER is part of the cell because peak_ski spans 15 Dec - 31 Mar;
             without it a Christmas night is referenced against mid-January prices and
             the optimizer recommends a large cut on the strongest night of the year.
  * P_ref  — the reference price at which p_ref was observed.
  * beta   — elasticity BY SEASON from policy. Luxury peak inventory is inelastic
             (|beta| < 1), which honestly implies "charge the ceiling"; shoulder
             is elastic (|beta| > 1), which produces a real interior optimum.
             Scaled toward more elastic when pacing is behind.

E[RevPAN] for one night = P * p(book | P). The composer maximizes this over a
grid spanning [floor, ceiling].
