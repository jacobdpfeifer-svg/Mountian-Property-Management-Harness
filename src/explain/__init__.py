"""Explainability — attribution, not narration.

The v1 build emitted reasons with hardcoded weights (base_compose=0.8, ceiling_gap=0.9,
...) and ranked by those constants. Because `base_compose` outranked most signals, the
top-3 reasons were dominated by boilerplate that appeared on every night regardless of
what actually moved the price. It described the inputs; it did not attribute the output.

Reasons now carry a `contribution` in dollars — the signed effect of that factor on the
final price — and are ranked by |contribution|. A reason that moved the price by $0 never
displaces one that moved it by $80.
