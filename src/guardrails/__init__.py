"""Guardrails and the data-health-gated autonomy ladder.

The operator chose auto-push. The operator also chose scraper-first comp data.
That pairing is the reason this module exists: bad scrapers rarely crash, they
quietly return stale or partial data, and an auto-push loop reading a depressed
comp number will move real rates on real inventory before anyone sees a dashboard.

Two mechanisms:

1. HARD INVARIANTS (`apply_guardrails`) — max move %, absolute move cap, sanity
   floor, peak blackout. No autonomy level may override these. A recommendation
   that violates one is clamped, and one that violates a blackout is blocked.

2. DERIVED AUTONOMY (`assess_data_health`) — the ladder level is COMPUTED from
   data freshness/coverage each run, never configured per-run. Stale PMS data or
   thin comp coverage automatically demotes 'handle' (writes rates) to 'suggest'
   (queues for approval, writes nothing).

Ladder: watch < suggest < handle < escalate
