# NOTE on `luxury_prior`: in v1 this value was read, stored on the context, rendered
# into a human-readable note, and then never used in any arithmetic — the advertised
# "-0.8 luxury elasticity" had zero effect on any price. Elasticity is now applied for
# real in src/bookprob (per-season beta, of which luxury_prior is the peak-season
# default). This module retains only the first-party conversion override.
